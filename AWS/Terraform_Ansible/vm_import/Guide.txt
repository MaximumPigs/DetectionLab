Step by step guide

    Build the lab by following the README

    Configure the AWS command line utility

    Create an S3 bucket. You will upload the DetectionLab VMs to this bucket later.

    For the VM importation to work, you must create a role named vmimport with a trust relationship policy document that allows VM Import to assume the role, and you must also attach an IAM policy to the role:

		aws iam create-role --role-name vmimport --assume-role-policy-document file:///path/to/DetectionLab/Terraform/vm_import/trust-policy.json

    Edit /path/to/DetectionLab/Terraform/vm_import/role-policy.json and insert the name of the bucket you created in step 3 on lines 12-13, replacing YOUR_BUCKET_GOES_HERE with the name of your bucket.

    Use the create-role command to create a role named vmimport and give VM Import/Export access to it:

		aws iam put-role-policy --role-name vmimport --policy-name vmimport --policy-document file:///path/to/DetectionLab/Terraform/vm_import/role-policy.json

    Export the DetectionLab VMs as single file OVA files if they are not already in that format
    Upload the OVAs to the S3 bucket you created in step three
    Edit the dc.json, wef.json and win10.json files and modify the S3Bucket and S3Key headers to match the location of the OVA files in your S3 bucket.
    Import the VMs from S3 as AMIs by running the following commands:

		aws ec2 import-image --description "dc" --license-type byol --disk-containers file:///path/to/DetectionLab/Terraform/vm_import/dc.json
		aws ec2 import-image --description "wef" --license-type byol --disk-containers file:///path/to/DetectionLab/Terraform/vm_import/wef.json
		aws ec2 import-image --description "win10" --license-type byol --disk-containers file:///path/to/DetectionLab/Terraform/vm_import/win10.json

    Check on the status of the importation with the following command:

		aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks --import-task-ids <import-ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx>

    Copy the file at /DetectionLab/Terraform/terraform.tfvars.example to /DetectionLab/Terraform/terraform.tfvars
    Fill out the variables in /DetectionLab/Terraform/terraform.tfvars
    Run terraform init to setup the initial Terraform configuration
    cd to DetectionLab/Terraform and run terraform apply
